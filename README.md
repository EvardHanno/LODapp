# LODapp
[R], shinyapps, LoDapp - educational app for explaining the concept of limit of detection with a simulated chromatogram

### Description
This is an application that lets people working with LC-MS/MS systems to better understand the concept of limit of detection. The app creates a simulated chromatogram for which different parameters can be changed. The noise distibution and peak height distribution are also shown.

### Work to be done
Some testing of the app should be done to find bugs or mistakes.
