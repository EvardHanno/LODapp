# LODapp
[R], shinyapps, LoDapp - educational app for explaining the concept of limit of detection with a simulated chromatogram

### Description
This is an application that lets people working with LC-MS/MS systems to better understand the concept of limit of detection. The app creates a simulated chromatogram for which different parameters can be changed. The noise distibution and peak height distribution are also shown.

### Work to be done
<<<<<<< HEAD
Some testing of the app should be done to find bugs or mistakes.
=======
At the moment the app in under development. For example the following changes to the app needs to be made:
* Better descriptions will be added to the app;
* S/N (peak-to-peak and noise from standard deviation) added to the chromatogram;
* Figure 2 uses input values and not the simulated values with random values. Changing this should be concidered but this can be quite complex;
* Connected with the previous point - Figure 2 does not take into account number of measurements made to evaluate standard deviation of the peak height;
* Some formatting to the graphs (names of axis and negative values in Figure 1) and a general formatting of the UI should be made to make the app look nicer.
